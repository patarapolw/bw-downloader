Run the server with `pnpm run serve`.

Copy `browser-vertical.js` to JavaScript console (tested in Chrome). Original source code from https://github.com/ChristopherFritz/BookWalker-Screenshot-Simulator

Horizontal Screenshot Simulator may be possible, but it seems challenging to make the page scroll...
